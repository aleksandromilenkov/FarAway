#Far Away App  
This is React application where you create a checklist of items that you need for your traveling.  
You can check the items that are already packed, and you get a useful output down below where you track how many % of your items are already packed.  
You can sort the items and clear the list also.  
I'm using the createContext and useContext React's hook for storing the state and access it accross the components.
